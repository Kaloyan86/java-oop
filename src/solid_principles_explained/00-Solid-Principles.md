# SOLID Principles

# SOLID Principles Overview

In Java, the classes are the **building blocks** of any application. 

If these blocks are not strong, the building (i.e. the **application**) is going to face a tough time in the future.

When the developer builds a software following the **bad design**, the code can become inflexible and more brittle, **small changes in the software can result in bugs**.

For these reasons, we should follow **SOLID** Principles.

**SOLID** Principles is a **coding standard** that all developers should have a **clear concept** for developing software in a **proper way** to **avoid a bad design**.

It was promoted by **Robert Martin** and is used across the object-oriented design spectrum.

When applied properly it makes your code more **extendable**, **logical** and **easier to read**.

**S.O.L.I.D** represents five principles of Java which are:

- **S** – **Single responsibility** principle – class should only have one responsibility
- **O** – **Open–closed** principle – open for extension, but closed for modification
- **L** – **Liskov substitution** principle – objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program
- **I** – **Interface segregation** principle – many specific interfaces are better than one general interface
- **D** – **Dependency inversion** principle – one should depend upon abstractions, not concretions
