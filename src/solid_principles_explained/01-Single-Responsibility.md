# Single Responsibility

"A class should have **one**, and **only one**, reason to change".

This is the first **SOLID** principle - **Single Responsibility**.

One class should serve **only one purpose**.

This does not imply that each class should have only one method, but they should all **relate directly** to the **responsibility of the class**.

All the **methods and properties** should work towards the **same goal**.

When a class serves **multiple purposes or responsibilities**, it should be made into a **new class**.

Let's see the following example:

```java
public class HeroSettings {​

  public static void changeName(Hero hero) {​

  }​

  public static void selectRole(Hero hero) {​

  }

  public void printHeroName(){

  }

  public void printHeroRole(){

  }
}
```
From the name of the class, we can find out what exactly it is responsible for, in this case, the settings of the hero. 

Therefore, in this class, we should not look for something that is not related to the settings of the character.

But in the code above, we have two responsibilities: **manipulating** and **printing**.

Having a method that prints out the hero features in this class **violate the Single Responsibility Principle**. 

For this purpose, we should create another class, **which will only handle printing the hero features**:

```java
public class PrintHeroFeatures {​

  public void printHeroName(){

  }

  public void printHeroRole(){

  }
}
```

The **Single Responsibility principle** doesn’t mean that our classes should have only a few methods or be small in the amount of code they contain.​

The key is that the code that is inside the class must be **directly related to the main purpose** of the class and the work it does. 

It is good practice to **write methods that are accurate**, **concise**, and **to the point as possible**, although in some situations it is normal to have to write more lines of code inside the methods. 

Thanks to the **Single Responsibility principle**, we can easily detect and eliminate bugs in the software.​
